Outlook:
======

The theme dominating today's market revolves around the notion of "higher for longer" interest rates. Yields are experiencing a surge, reaching levels not observed since the Global Financial Crisis (GFC), and an unpredictable equity market mirrors this concept. While current growth indicators reinforce the argument for extended periods of higher interest rates, I anticipate a slowdown in long-term economic growth. Recent data continues to indicate robust gains in the third quarter, with the potential for real GDP growth to exceed 4.9% on an annualized basis. Notably, real consumer spending, which constitutes over two-thirds of GDP, appears to have increased by 4%. However, several challenges, including aging workforces, the impact of rising interest rates, and the resumption of student loan repayments, are poised to impede our economic progress. Additionally, a softer-than-expected inflation report, with headline CPI standing at 3.3%, brings clarity to the ongoing battle against inflation. This steady decline in inflation further diminishes the likelihood of a Federal Reserve interest rate hike at their December 12th & 13th meeting. Slower growth and decreasing inflation strengthen the case for lower interest rates in the foreseeable future.
